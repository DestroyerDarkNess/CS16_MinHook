# CS16_MinHook
![passing](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen) 

It is a small Cheat for CS 1.6, As a sample of a new concept of Overlay in windows.

I use the same method that the 'Wallpapers Engines' use in windows, to make an Overlay type. I've only tried it in Counter Strike, in OpenGL mode.

-  Activation: **INSERT**

# Librarys

These are the APIs that this project uses, download and add them.

- [Memory.dll](https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dll/)
- [Xylon.PH.dll](https://github.com/DestroyerDarkNess/Xylon.PH)
- [InputHelper.dll](https://github.com/Visual-Vincent/InputHelper) 


# Features

Pros

- Completely External, even if it pretends to be Internal.

Contra

- For some reason the overlay is blinking, it seems that the game is rendering on top of the overlay. but this fixes it, pausing the game process when i open the menu and it resumes when i hide the menu.
